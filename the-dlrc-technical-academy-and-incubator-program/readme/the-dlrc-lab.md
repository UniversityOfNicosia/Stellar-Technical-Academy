{% tab title="Research & Engagement" %}
We focus on applied research. The aim of DLRC is to jointly transform academic research into applications that can benefit the wider Blockchain ecosystem, including NFTs and the Metaverse.

* Blockchain Protocols Decentralized Finance (DeFi)&#x20;
* Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)
* Blockchain-based Metaverse&#x20;
* Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)&#x20;
* Technology and Infrastructure Challenges in Blockchains&#x20;
* Convergence of Blockchain with AI, IoT, and VR&#x20;
* Data Science and Analytics in Blockchains&#x20;
* Forecasting&#x20;
* Machine Learning and AI in NFTs and the Metaverse
