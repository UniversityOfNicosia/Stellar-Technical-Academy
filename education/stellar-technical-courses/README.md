# ðŸ“’ Stellar Technical Courses

University of Nicosia (UNIC), aims to provide educational support in bridging the gap between technical education and hands-on experience through the recently launched [Stellar Next-Gen](https://stellar.org/foundation/next-gen), an initiative established with the objective to foster the growth and development of blockchain and FinTech education amongst tomorrowâ€™s business leaders and developers. &#x20;

As part of the agreement, both parties will collaborate on a technical Stellar certificate course, operated under the [Distributed Ledgers Research Centre (DLRC) at UNICâ€™s Institute For the Future (IFF)](https://www.unic.ac.cy/school-of-business/department-of-digital-innovation/dlrc/). The technical course is aligned with IFFâ€™s philosophy that education drives mass adoption of an emerging technology.

The course aims to:

* provide technical education for developers
* expose Stellarâ€™s ecosystem of development tools
* explore Stellarâ€™s multi-currency network and logic
* acknowledge the mission and actions of the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF)
* build the killer applications on the Stellar blockchain
