# Glossary

This is the glossary of terms used in the slide decks of the courses. This is a living document. We will try to update it to contain any terms used in the Stellar, but also in the blockchain ecosystem

## A

**ACH (Automated Clearing House)** **:** payment is an electronic bank-to-bank payment in the U.S. which allows direct deposits and direct payments. ​

**Arbitrary :** data is data in any format.  ​

**Ask :** the price in which the market maker is willing to sell the asset.&#x20;

## B

**Ballots :** are a container for a nominated value. The goal is that in the balloting phase the quorum will commit to it. Once the quorum committed to the ballot, this value is the result of this circle for the consensus. ​

**Banking-as-a Service :** is an end-to-end process which is restructuring the banking value chain. The banks merge their digital banking services with the products of other non-bank business. Such a digital banking service is available on-demand and operates within a set time-frame. ​

**Bid :** the price at which a market maker is willing to buy more of the asset.  ​

**BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals) :** a formal proposal to change Bitcoin. The BIP process organizes the Bitcoin community in the absence of a centralized leader and can propose changes to Bitcoin's consensus layer, community standards, or the development process. ​

**Borrowing :** is the counterpart to lending. The borrowed money can be used for example for trading with leverage. A fee or interest will be paid for the borrowed money over a specific period of time. ​

## C

**Circulating Supply :** is the number of coins which are available in the ecosystem. ​

**Cross-border payment :**  is a financial transaction to a recipient’s bank account which is not based in the sender's country. ​

## D

**Decentralized Exchange (DEX) :** is a peer-to-peer marketplace. The market participants operate without giving the control over their funds to an intermediary or custodian.  ​

**Double-spending :** is the problem that the same digital token can be used twice.​

**Downtime :** refers to the time a system is unavailable, offline or not operational.&#x20;

## E

**EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals) :** are standards specifying potential new features or processes for Ethereum. EIPs contain technical specifications for the proposed changes and act as the ‘source of truth’ for the community. Network upgrades and application standards for Ethereum are discussed and developed through the EIP process.​

**Equity token :** is a type of security token which represents an equity in an underlying asset. A share of a company. The equity token may give the holder voting rights and dividends. ​

## F

**Fiat currency :** is ‘legal tender’ backed by a central government, such as the Federal Reserve, and with its own banking system, such as fractional reserve banking.  &#x20;

**FinTech :** means Financial Technology. It’s a generic term for financial innovations, financial instruments or financial services. ​

**Fork :** is a change or divergence in the software code, the blockchain, or the network consensus. It can result in a hard or soft fork.&#x20;

## H

**Hard fork :** are a type of fork that is not backward compatible. For changes to the blockchain to be considered, it is mandatory for existing nodes to update their software to establish an understanding between old and new nodes. Hard forks bring special challenges to generating consensus in the network because the incompatibility of the different versions necessarily leads to the network being split. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is an example of a hard fork. The cryptocurrency has a higher transaction speed and is less decentralized.  ​

**Hashing :** is a computational process by converting a given key into another value.​ ​

## I

**Internet of Things (IoT) :** connects physical objects with the virtual world. Intelligent devices and machines are interconnected and exchange information via the internet.  ​

**Interoperability** **:** is the ability of different blockchain systems to see, access and share information.​ ​

**InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) :** is a protocol designed to provide a content-addressable, peer-to-peer method of storing and sharing hypermedia in a distributed file system. ​

## J

**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) :** is a lightweight data-interchange format.

## L

**Layer 1 blockchain :** is a base network which represents the main infrastructure. BTC, ETH, Cardano and Solana are operating on Layer 1. Such protocols have to be decentralized, secure and scalable. ​ ​

**Ledger :** is a record-keeping system which stores data. ​

**Lending :** means that you provide temporary money. The money is locked for a specific amount of time in the smart contract. The participant gets the money back with interest. ​

**Liquidity :** the ability of a coin to be easily converted into cash or other coins. ​

**Liquidity mining :** means providing liquidity to a DEX and lending platforms in exchange for interest and a share of transaction fees. ​

**Liquidity pool :** is a pool of funds placed into a smart contract to provide liquidity for decentralized exchanges (DEX), lending and borrowing protocols, and other DeFi applications. ​

## M

**Metadata :** is a set of data that describes and gives information about other data.​ ​

M**ining :** is the process of creating new bitcoin by solving a mathematical calculation. ​

## N

**Nodes :** refer to the peers of the peer-to-peer network that validate blocks of transactions and approve or reject them. Moreover, they broadcast data in a network, spread the history and synchronize with the blockchain. The connection points serve as a point for distributing data or processing data as an endpoint e.g., storing the blocks of transactions. ​

**Non-circulating Supply :** are the tokens which are not released to the ecosystem.  ​

**Non-custodial :** gives you sole control of your private key. It gives you full control of your cryptocurrency and proves that the funds are yours. ​

## O

**Off-chain :** means that transactions have a relation towards blockchain and don’t happen on the blockchain. The transactions are performed, checked and saved e.g., on a sidechain.​ ​

**Off-ramp crypto :** when you spend cryptocurrency in exchange for something that is not a digital asset. ​

**On-chain :** the action takes place on the blockchain. The transaction is directly saved in the history, as soon as the transaction is validated.  ​

**On-ramp crypto :** when you receive cryptocurrency in exchange for something that is not a digital asset. ​

**Open-source network :** is a network that by design is publicly accessible and anyone can inspect, modify and enhance its source code.&#x20;

## P

**P2P (Peer-to-Peer) :** payment is an electronic financial transaction from one person to another person without the use of an intermediary. ​

**Private key :** is a secret number that is used in cryptography, and it is like a password. It is unique and it gives its holder the possibility to access the funds at any time. ​

**Public key :** allows to receive cryptocurrency transactions and it is paired with a private key. With the public key you can make transactions and confirm them with the use of your private key. ​

**Public ledger :** is a distributed public database which maintains and secures the cryptocurrency balance and keeps a record of all the executed transactions. ​

## Q

**Quorum slices :** refer to a selected, trusted subgroup of peers on the network. These nodes trust each other for the current state of voting. Each node defines its own quorum slice. ​

**Quorum :** in distributed systems refers to the rule of majority. For the Stellar network, a node does not commit to a past version of the history until there are enough peers which are ready to commit. ​

## S

**Settlement :** is the process of transacting funds from one wallet to another wallet.​ ​

**Single atomic transaction :** is an indivisible and irreducible database operation​.​

**Slippage :** is the situation when the price at which your order is executed does not match the price at which it was requested. This occurs when the market moves against your trade and the original price has changed during the period when your broker executes your order.​ ​

**Smart cities :** are urban spaces that are made more efficient by utilizing digital solutions to achieve sustainability.​ ​

**Smart contracts :** are self-executing contracts and fulfill the agreement between two entities. The contract is written in lines of code. ​

**Soft fork :** provides backward compatibility by changing the code. Older versions of the software will still work after a fork and there may be nodes on the network that are compatible with the new software. In the old software with compatible nodes, the opinions of users who chose to use the new software are accepted and compatibility issues can be bypassed. Old and new nodes can therefore continue to work together. ​ ​

**SQL Database :** stands for Structured Query Language. This standardized programming language is used for managing data held in relational database management systems (RDBMS) and to execute various operations on this data. &#x20;

**Stablecoins :** are digital currencies, which are pegged to a reserve asset like the US Dollar. This reduces the volatility when we compare it with bitcoin. ​

**Staking :** is participation in the network and contributing to its stability and security, by locking cryptocurrencies in a smart contract. In exchange, there will be remuneration in the form of cryptocurrencies.&#x20;

## T

**Timestamp :** is a temporal parameter. It is used to keep records of information in the network. The Timestamp is used when information is created, exchanged, modified or deleted. ​

**Total supply :** is the number of tokens that are existing on the blockchain. This includes tokens that are not in public circulation. ​

**Treasury management :** a management system that aims to optimise a company’s liquidity, while also mitigating its financial, operational, and reputational risk. ​

**TSS :** is a network of servers which store smart contracts and is able to build and sign transactions according to the uploaded smart contract and specifications of the user's request.​ ​

## U

**Uptime :** refers to the time a system runs without a shutdown or restart. Server uptime is the total duration for which a server is fully functional and running. It is a metric used to denote the performance of a server.

## W

**Wire payment :** allows two parties in different locations to transfer funds without the need to exchange cash.

## X

**XDR :** files means External Data Representation which is used by parsers to understand parse data.

## Y

**Yield farming :** combines common DeFi applications (borrowing, lending, staking and liquidity mining) using smart contracts to optimize returns across protocols. These are interacting smart contracts that take advantage of the established applications to generate the maximum return for the investor as a result.
