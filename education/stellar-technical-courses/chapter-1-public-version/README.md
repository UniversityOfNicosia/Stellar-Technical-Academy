# Chapter I (Public Series)

An overview of what Stellar is, how it works and what purpose(s) it serves are covered during this course. Throughout this course an attempt to introduce the Stellar primitives, including the mission and actions of the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) and the built-in token lumen is made. A set of practical exercises are complementing the course enabling participants to get familiar with the theoretical concepts in a more practical way.
