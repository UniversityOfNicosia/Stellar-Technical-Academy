# Blockchain Tech Academy

* Blockchain Tech Academy is “blockchain agnostic”; education has no boundaries and as such the academy aims to provide training material to a wide spectrum of blockchain platforms and ecosystems
* Blockchain Tech Academy aspires to become a “hot-spot” of knowledge tailored to developers that aim to evolve their hands-on skillset on becoming certified industry-leading blockchain developers
* Blockchain Tech Academy aims to provide opportunities to innovate by providing access to an incubator program that aims to connect various blockchain platforms with start-ups that emerge through the ecosystem – designed to help start-ups in their infancy succeed by providing mentoring and training

#### Blockchain Tech Academy and Incubator Program is an initiative of the DLRC Lab
